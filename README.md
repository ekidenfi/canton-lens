Public-chain explorers show everyone the same ledger. A Canton participant's ledger is
private and permissioned: two Canton identities on the same participant may legitimately see
different contracts. Canton Lens leaves those visibility decisions to Canton
and presents only the data returned for the selected identity.

## Features

- **Permission-Scoped:** Every ledger-data request uses the selected user or service token, so the
  Canton participant decides which transactions, contracts, parties, and tokens are visible.
- **Canton-Native:** Investigate transactions and contracts across multiple parties, inspect
  Splice token activity, and browse installed Daml-LF packages and templates.
- **UI and API:** Use the included React explorer or integrate with its documented Backend API.
  An OpenAPI document is available at `/openapi.json`.
- **Flexible authentication:** Use Backend-managed Client Credentials for a shared Canton
  identity, or Browser OIDC for per-user access. Shared-identity credentials remain
  Backend-only, and issued tokens are cached only in memory.

## Explore

| View | What you can inspect |
| --- | --- |
| **Overview** | Ledger position, visible contracts, token kinds, pending offers, and recent activity at one snapshot offset. |
| **Transactions & contracts** | Update events, active contract payloads, signatories, observers, and decoded template fields and choices. |
| **Parties & tokens** | Party relationships, Splice token holdings, transfer instructions, and preapprovals. |
| **Timeline** | Contract creation and archival across a selected range of ledger offsets. |
| **Developer tools** | Installed Daml-LF packages, template definitions, participant status, and the OpenAPI document. |

<table>

  </tr>
</table>

Recent activity lists look back over a window that widens until it holds 500 of the selected identity's
transactions, up to 128,000 offsets; the timeline covers a chosen offset range. Data pruned by the participant is
not recovered by the explorer.

The Explorer reads the JSON Ledger API and nothing else. That API serves current state and a recent
window of updates, so older history and full-text search are outside what these screens can answer.
Serving those needs a separate store fed from the ledger, such as a Participant Query Store, which
this project does not integrate.

## Choose your authentication setup

Run the Explorer with its UI, or use the Backend API on its own.

### With the Explorer UI

For a direct deployment, choose one of these profiles. Missing or invalid configuration
fails closed; there is no automatic fallback or mode inference.

| Frontend `VITE_AUTH_MODE` (build time) | Backend `LEDGER_AUTH_MODE` (startup) | Identity |
|---|---|---|
| `browser-oidc` | `caller-bearer` | Individual user, Browser PKCE access token |
| `shared-identity` | `shared-identity` | One shared Canton service identity, Backend Client Credentials |

Rebuild the Frontend to change `VITE_AUTH_MODE`; restart the Backend to change
`LEDGER_AUTH_MODE` or `SHARED_IDENTITY_*`. Caller-bearer needs no Backend OIDC settings and
refuses leftover shared-identity configuration. See
[Shared Identity deployment](docs/deployment.md#shared-identity) for server-only configuration and
rotation.

For per-user access without exposing a Canton token to Browser JavaScript, use the
[`institution-bff` profile](docs/deployment.md#institution-bff).

### Backend API only

The Backend can also run without the Frontend. In this case, `VITE_AUTH_MODE` does not apply.

| Backend `LEDGER_AUTH_MODE` | Credential path |
|---|---|
| `caller-bearer` | The API client sends a Canton-compatible Bearer token with each `/api/*` request |
| `shared-identity` | The client sends no Bearer token; the Backend obtains one shared token with Client Credentials |

> Shared Identity Mode does not authenticate individual users. Every request is executed using
> one configured Canton service identity. The operator is responsible for controlling access to
> the Explorer. Every user sees the same Lens; never expose this API without operator-managed
> access control.

## Runtime boundaries

The repository is split into independently runnable parts:

| Part | Owns | Does not own |
|---|---|---|
| [`apps/frontend/`](apps/frontend/) | React UI, routing, and optional Browser OIDC login | Direct ledger access, server secrets, backend sessions |
| [`apps/backend/`](apps/backend/) | HTTP API, OpenAPI, and optional shared-identity token management | HTML, CSS, frontend assets, user login/sessions |
| [`packages/core/`](packages/core/) | Pure ledger-domain logic: identifier matching, visibility filtering, lag and balance computation; zero runtime dependencies | HTTP, authentication, anything that runs in a browser |
| [`packages/design-system/`](packages/design-system/) | Design tokens and domain-free React primitives | Ledger, API and authentication knowledge |

The authentication profile determines where the Canton credential comes from. In
`caller-bearer` mode, each request carries a per-user token supplied by the caller. In
`shared-identity` mode, the Browser sends no token; the Backend uses a server-held client ID
and secret to obtain and cache one shared Canton token.

## Deploy with Docker

Two containers behind one origin: nginx serves the built UI and forwards `/api/*` and
`/openapi.json` to the Backend. Node and pnpm are needed only inside the build.

Requires Docker Compose v2 — the `docker compose` subcommand, not the standalone
`docker-compose` v1 script, which reads neither the top-level `name` nor a required
`${VAR:?message}` variable.

```bash
cp docker/.env.example docker/.env
chmod 600 docker/.env
docker compose -f docker/compose.yaml up -d --build
```

Every value lives in `docker/.env`, which is not committed; the compose file holds none. The
published port binds to loopback by default — the containers terminate no TLS and enforce no
access control. See [Docker](docs/deployment.md#docker).

## Quick start

You need Node.js 22.18 or newer, pnpm 9, and a Canton participant reachable through JSON
Ledger API v2. Browser OIDC also needs an issuer with a public client registered for the
Explorer. This repository starts neither the participant nor the issuer. Install the
dependencies first:

```bash
corepack enable
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
cp apps/frontend/.env.example apps/frontend/.env
cp apps/backend/.env.example apps/backend/.env
```

Configure one matching profile in the copied files:

**Browser OIDC** — per-user browser login

```dotenv
# apps/frontend/.env
VITE_AUTH_MODE=browser-oidc
VITE_OIDC_ISSUER=https://issuer.example
VITE_OIDC_CLIENT_ID=explorer-browser

# apps/backend/.env
LEDGER_AUTH_MODE=caller-bearer
LEDGER_BASE=https://canton.example
```

**Shared Identity** — one Backend-managed Canton identity

```dotenv
# apps/frontend/.env
VITE_AUTH_MODE=shared-identity

# apps/backend/.env
LEDGER_AUTH_MODE=shared-identity
LEDGER_BASE=https://canton.example
SHARED_IDENTITY_ISSUER=https://issuer.example
SHARED_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID=explorer-service
SHARED_IDENTITY_CLIENT_SECRET=replace-with-secret
SHARED_IDENTITY_SCOPES=ledger.read
```

For Shared Identity, remove the unused `VITE_OIDC_*` values from `apps/frontend/.env`.

The Explorer does not select a profile or fall back to another one automatically. See
[Browser OIDC](docs/deployment.md#browser-oidc) or
[Shared Identity](docs/deployment.md#shared-identity) for provider configuration and production
requirements.

Then start the frontend and backend in separate terminals:

```bash
pnpm dev:backend       # JSON API :7600, no authentication proxy
pnpm dev:frontend      # frontend :5173
```

Open `http://localhost:5173/`.

Before production, review the [deployment guide](docs/deployment.md) and
[security boundaries](docs/security.md) for the selected profile.
