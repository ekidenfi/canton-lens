// Recent-window updates + the active contracts -> **contract lifetimes** (the Timeline screen's bars).
//
// One lifeline is one contract: the point it was created and the point it was archived, both as ledger
// offsets. Canton has no blocks, so the offset is the mark that counts one thing after another.
//
// **Why two inputs.** The update window says what was created and archived *inside* the window; the ACS says
// what is alive *now*. A contract that had no event in the window has no row in the updates at all yet lived
// through the whole of it, and a contract that died before the window is in neither (that one cannot be
// drawn, and the screen says so).
//
// **"End unknown" is kept apart from "still alive".** An archived event carries no signatories or observers
// (the ledger does not give them; only witnessParties), so a party-filtered window can miss the end of a
// contract — the same rule filter-recent-updates states. Calling that "alive" would be inventing a fact. A
// contract with no archive in the window and no place in the active contracts is `unknown`, not `alive`.
//
// This function judges nothing about visibility: both inputs are already the requester's visible scope, and
// they arrive as values other core functions have finished judging (buildRecentUpdates · buildContractList).
// It also reads no clock and computes no geometry — where a bar sits on screen is the screen's arithmetic.
