// **GET /api/timeline, written out again by hand.**
//
// A timeline bar is a claim about when a contract began and when it ended, so this answer is built from two
// reads at one offset: the updates of the window (what was created and archived inside it) and the active
// contracts (what is alive at its end). The rules below were written by reading router.ts and
// core/timeline/build-lifelines.ts and stating again what they do; nothing here calls them.
//
// **Three states, not two.** An archived event carries no signatories or observers — only witnessParties —
// so a contract can leave the window without its end being visible. "No archive seen" therefore splits into
// `alive` (it is in the active contracts) and `unknown` (it is not, and we cannot say why). Calling the
// second one alive would be inventing a fact, and a rule that did so would have to be written here too.
