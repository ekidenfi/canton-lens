// **GET /api/search, written out again by hand.**
//
// **One box, and two honest grades of answer.** There is no index to search: the Ledger API offers none, and
// this application keeps no history of its own. So an id-shaped input gets an exact point lookup and nothing
// else — "similar ids" is not a thing that can exist — while a name-shaped input is matched inside the
// catalogue we already count, which is free and adds no visibility question. There is no full-text search,
// and the answer says so in a slot rather than returning nothing and letting the screen guess.
//
// **A section that does not apply is not an empty section.** not_applicable, ok-with-no-rows and unavailable
// are three different sentences, and keeping them apart is most of what these rules say.
//
// Written by reading router.ts, core/search/classify-search-input.ts and core/search/build-search-results.ts.
