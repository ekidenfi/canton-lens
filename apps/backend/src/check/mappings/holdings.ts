// A Canton balance is not a number in an account — it is the sum of several Holding contracts, the way a
// UTXO balance is. So this answer groups my visible holdings by (instrument, owner), sums them, and keeps
// the contracts the sum is made of so the screen can drill down instead of asking again.
//
// **It asks the node through the standard Holding interface**, not by template name: a token is a thing that
// implements the standard, and the node attaches its own view of it. So the trace for this path holds an
// *interface-filtered* active-contracts question, which is a different question from the unnarrowed one and
// is picked out by the id that was asked for.
//
// Written by reading router.ts, envelope.ts (`toRawCreatedEvents`) and
// core/token-holdings/build-token-holdings.ts.
