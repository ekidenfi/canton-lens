// **GET /api/home, written out again by hand.**
//
// The home is a summary of **my** workspace, not the network's — two people opening it see different
// numbers, and that is the product's first principle stated as a screen. Three things it upholds, and each
// of them is a rule below:
//
//   ① A viewer with no party rights does not get an empty scoreboard. The whole card row is replaced by one
//      line. **And holding no parties is not the same as holding no rights**: a super reader holds none of
//      their own and reads every party there is, so this is decided on the scope and never on the count.
//   ② Parties and zero contracts is an honest 0. A card whose lookup failed is not 0 — it is unavailable
//      with a reason, because "nothing there" and "we could not look" are different sentences.
//   ③ Cards, list and sparkline are one snapshot: one offset, and the graph is bucketed from the very array
//      the list was cut from, so the two counts cannot drift apart.
//
// Written by reading router.ts and core/home-summary (three files).
