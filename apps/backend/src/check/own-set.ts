// **The second recording: what the node says this person can see, asked without going through us.**
//
// The tape (ledger-tape.ts) is the answer to *our* questions, so it can only judge what we did with what we
// received. It cannot judge the question itself. When the application asks the node for too little, the tape
// holds too little, replay serves too little, the screen draws too little — and everything agrees. A whole
// class of defect (a contract quietly missing from someone's list) is invisible from inside that loop.
//
// So there is a second recording, made by asking the node directly with a person's token. **It computes
// nothing** — it asks and stores. Two questions, and only two:
//
//   1. POST /v2/state/active-contracts — every contract this person can see at this offset
//   2. POST /v2/updates                — every update this person can see from 0 to this offset
//
// Nothing else is in scope: trees, reassignments and completions are not things this product shows.
//
// This file is the format and the comparison. The recording itself is made later, once every address has
// rules; settling the shape first is what keeps the recorder from deciding it by accident.
