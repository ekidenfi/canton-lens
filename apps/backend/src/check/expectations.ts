// **What is asked, and what counts as passing.** This file is the check's standard.
//
// The judgment has four levels (spec: "the design of the check"):
//   ① it answers      — no 5xx. Asked with a token, so it should be 200.
//   ② it matches      — it passes the openapi 200 schema (`additionalProperties:false` + `required`).
//   ③ it has content  — a list such as `rows` being empty is a failure.
//   ④ it is derived   — every value is what the rules in check/mappings/ say the node's answer produces.
//                       Only the addresses that have rules are judged at this level; the rest stop at ③.
//
// Why ③ is needed: **an empty array means JSON Schema's `items` never runs at all.** So ② can be green while
// most of the schema went unchecked. ③ is the precondition for ②.
//
// Writing the minimum only as "one or more" is deliberate — an exact count breaks on one line of seeding.
// Where the requirement is a *property* rather than a count ("every package decodes"), it is written as a
// property: that does not move with the seed, and it catches what a count cannot.

// the check could only ever run as a fully-provisioned user — the user whose answers reveal the least.

// The statements below say what each address owes each person. They are judged **both ways**: a 403 where
// this person should have been served is a defect, and so is a 200 where they should have been refused.
