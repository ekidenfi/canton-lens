// **What the recording has to contain for the rules to bite.**
//
// Every level above judges an answer against a rule. None of them can tell the difference between a rule that
// held and a rule that was never reached: a sentence about decaying tokens is agreed with perfectly by a
// ledger that issues none. Phase 4 found eight such sentences by mutation — break the product, nothing goes
// red — and each was written down beside the rule as a data condition the seed owed. Written down in a
// comment, they rot: the seed changes, nobody reads the comment, and the check goes on being green about
// nothing.
//
// So they are stated here as **claims about the material**, and a claim nothing satisfies is a finding. This
// is not a judgement about the product — the product may be perfect while the recording is thin — which is
// why it is its own level (⑥) and says what it says: *this rule is no longer being exercised*.
//
// **A condition is shown by an answer, never by the seed script.** Reading it from the dev stack's setup
// would make the check agree with the thing that produced it; reading it from our own answer means the
// material actually travelled the whole path, node to rule, and arrived.
