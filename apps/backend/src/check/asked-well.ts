// **Judging the question, not only the answer.**
//
// Every other level reads what came back. But the tape is the node's answer to *our* question, so when the
// application asks for too little, the tape holds too little, replay serves too little, and every level
// agrees with itself. Narrowing the request is the one defect this product must never have — it is the
// product's whole first principle ("Canton enforces visibility; we never filter") inverted — and it is
// invisible from inside that loop.
//
// The complete answer to that is the second recording (own-set.ts), which asks the node directly. This file
// is the part that needs no second recording at all: **what the request itself says.** Three claims, all
// checkable against things the check already holds independently of any answer:
//
//   · the parties named in the request are exactly the ones this person was *given* (check/given.ts), or
//     the request names none and uses `filtersForAnyParty`, which only a super reader may do;
//   · the offset the request reads at is the offset the ledger end reported, when the caller named none;
//   · a point lookup asks for the thing the address named.
//
// All of them are about the question. None is derived from what came back, so none can be laundered by a
// wrong answer.
