// **The answer a real participant gave, drawn.**
//
// Everything before this judged the API. An API that is right and a screen that drops half of it is the same
// failure to the person reading it, and nothing on the server side can see it. So here the backend is stood
// up over the recorded ledger, its answers are taken as they are, and each screen is handed one and rendered.
//
// Four questions, one per screen:
//   ⑥ is every row of the answer on the screen — asked by looking for **what each row says it is**, not by
//     counting <tr>: a header is a <tr> too, one update can be two rows, and `total` is legitimately not the
//     number of rows. A count would be green while the rows were wrong.
//   ⑦ is every value of a row on the screen — delete `<RoleChips>` and the roles have to vanish with it.
//   ⑧ when the screen shows fewer than there are, does it say so.
//   ⑨ when the read failed, does it say that — rather than drawing an empty list.
//
// This only renders. Clicking is out of scope and stays out: a static render never fires an effect, so
// "Older" loses the earlier page (Contracts.tsx) is a thing review catches and this does not.
