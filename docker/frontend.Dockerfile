# ── Build the browser bundle ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The build reads the VITE_* values through vite.config.ts (loadEnv merges the build environment
# with .env files) and Vite writes them into the JavaScript as literals. They are therefore fixed
# for the life of the image — docs/deployment.md: "VITE_AUTH_MODE is fixed when the Frontend is
# built". Changing one needs a rebuild, not a restart.
#
# Pass no secret as a build argument. An ARG value is recorded in the history of the stage that
# declares it, is printed in build output, and stays in the build cache. The published image here
# carries only the serving stage below, so it does not hold these values — but that is a property
# of this two-stage layout, not a guarantee about build arguments. Only VITE_* values belong here,
# and those are public by design: they are delivered to every browser inside the bundle.
#
# Node 24 (Active LTS) for the same reason as the Backend image: the CI matrix runs it. Nothing
# from this stage reaches the final image, so this version only has to build the bundle.
